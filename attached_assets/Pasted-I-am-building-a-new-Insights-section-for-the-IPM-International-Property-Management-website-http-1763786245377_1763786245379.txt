I am building a new “Insights” section for the IPM – International Property Management website (https://ipm.services
).

I have a PDF that contains the full content for the main Insights page and 5 subpages:

Airbnb Fees Explained

API Connections & Hidden Costs

How to Avoid the 15.5% Fee

Check-In System Design (IPM Method)

IPM Video Library

Your task:

Create clean, responsive HTML + CSS (and minimal JS only if needed) for:

One parent page: Insights

Five subpages listed above.

The design should look professional, modern, and consistent with an international property management brand (IPM).

Include a top navigation where Insights is a main tab, and the 5 subpages are accessible as sub-links or section links.

Each subpage should have:

A clear H1 title

Section headings that match the structure in the PDF

Body text pulled accurately from the PDF content (no rewriting needed, just format it well)

A CTA section at the bottom that says:
“Book a Consultation with IPM
Optimize your property, reduce costs, and increase profits. Click below to get started.
[Schedule a Call]”

Make the Schedule a Call button a placeholder link (e.g. href="#") so I can replace it later.

On the IPM Video Library page, create placeholder sections and cards where I can later embed videos (just use dummy thumbnails and titles for now).

Technical requirements:

Use semantic HTML (section, header, main, footer, etc.).

Use clean, readable CSS (prefer a single CSS file).

Make sure the layout is mobile-friendly (responsive).

Do NOT use any frameworks (no Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc.) – just plain HTML + CSS.

Structure the files so I can easily integrate them into my existing website or adapt them into my CMS.

Here is the PDF with the content:

Here is additional context from a ChatGPT conversation that explains the concepts and structure I want:

Please:

Parse the content from the PDF and conversation.

Build the full multi-page “Insights” section.

Show me the full HTML + CSS code, clearly separated.
