  "price": "$XXX/night",
  "guests": 8,
  "bedrooms": 4,
  "bathrooms": 3,
  "description": "Detailed property description...",
  "features": ["Feature 1", "Feature 2"],
  "amenities": ["Amenity 1", "Amenity 2"],
  "availability": "Available year-round"
}
```
3. Add corresponding property images to the `src/assets/` directory
4. Update the `propertyImages` object in relevant components

## 🛠️ Customization
